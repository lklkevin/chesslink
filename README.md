# ChessLink - Smart Hardware Chess Interface

![ChessLink Banner](public/images/chesslink_banner.png)

**ChessLink** is a smart chess interface that bridges physical chess with digital capabilities. The hardware-focused system uses custom sensor arrays to detect moves on a physical board and synchronize them with a digital platform for analysis, training, and connected play.

## Hardware Architecture

### Core Hardware Components

- **Sensor Array**: 64-square (8Ã—8) matrix of Hall effect sensors that detect magnetic chess pieces, 64-square (8x8) matrix of phototransistors which measure current, 64-square (8Ã—8) matrix of RGB LEDs, 64-square (8Ã—8) matrix of IR emitters.
- **LED System**: RGB LEDs integrated into each square for visual feedback and move guidance
- **Microcontroller Unit**: ESP32-C3 (master) combined with 16 ATtiny microcontrollers (slave) communicating through UART
- **PCB Design**: Custom multi-layer PCB (currently in development) integrating all electronic components
- **Power System**: 5V system with regulated power distribution for sensors, LEDs, and microcontrollers
- **I/O Interface**: Serial/USB connection to host application, with Bluetooth/WiFi capabilities

### PCB Development (In Progress)

The team is currently developing a custom PCB solution that will:

- **Integrate all sensor components** into a compact, reliable board design
- **Employ multiple controllers** to efficiently manage 64 squares with minimal pins and low latency
- **Include dedicated LED drivers** for controlling RGB LEDs at each board position
- **Provide noise filtering** to ensure accurate sensor readings
- **Support multiple communication protocols** including I2C, UART, and SPI
- **Feature expansion headers** for future hardware add-ons

### Sensor Technology

In prototype 1, the ChessLink system uses the following two design mechanisms for detecting pieces: 

1. Hall effect sensors placed beneath each square of the chessboard. These sensors:
- Detect the magnetic field of specially prepared chess pieces
- Offer reliable, precise detection regardless of lighting conditions
- Operate with minimal power consumption
- Provide long-term reliability without mechanical wear

2. Phototransisters placed beneath each square of the chessboard. These sensors: 
- Detect the analog light emitance reflectance of a piece based on shined light against the bottom of a piece.
   - Enables both RGB LED emittance and IR LED emmitance detection at 940nm.
- Offer cheap, piece and piece-type detection
- Operates with minimal power
- Wired to a pull-down resister to ensure that ADC voltage can be measured. 

Based on results of the prototype 1 PCB, the board will be adjusted accordingly. The board can utilize multiple sensors combined to provide accurate results. As the Hall-Effect system detects that a piece exists but does not detect which piece the two can be utilized together to create a reliable system of detection.
