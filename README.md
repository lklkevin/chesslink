## Overview

**What problem it solves:**  
- Preserves the **physical** feel of playing chess while adding **digital** capabilities like move recording and analysis.  
- Assists beginners in learning with real-time feedback and highlighted valid moves.  
- Enables streamlined post-game analysis for players who want to review their decisions and improve.

**Who it is for:**  
- Chess enthusiasts seeking a hybrid of real-board and online analysis.  
- Beginners who learn best by doing and receiving immediate feedback.  
- Organized events and streamers who need real-time, interactive move tracking.

**Key insights:**  
- All piece movements are captured automatically, no more manual recording of games.  
- Integrates with a **web application** to store and analyze moves using a chess engine or other learning tools.

## Features

- **Real-Time Move Tracking**  
  Detects piece movements via sensors and updates a digital interface.

- **LED Feedback**  
  Highlights valid moves, checks, or other important chess events.

- **Audio Prompts**  
  Announces moves (e.g., in algebraic notation) and signals special situations like check or checkmate.

- **Online Integration**  
  Syncs with a web application to record games, provide analysis, or connect to remote opponents.

- **Training & Analysis Modes**  
  - **Training**: Offers real-time suggestions and visual/audio guidance.  
  - **Analysis**: Provides post-game data and best-move recommendations.

## Hardware Overview

- **Sensors**: Hall-effect sensors, near-IR sensors, or photodiodes to detect when pieces are moved or lifted.  
- **Arduino Nano (or similar)**: Reads sensor data and sends updates via serial communication.  
- **LEDs**: Provide guidance for moves or highlight errors and special scenarios.  
- **Board Size**: Prototype is 4x4 for proof of concept; the ultimate goal is a full 8x8 board.

This approach preserves the physical experience of chess while adding an intelligent, interactive layer.

## Software Overview

1. **Board Sensors → Arduino**  
   As soon as you move a piece, the board’s sensors note the change in position.

2. **Arduino → Web App**  
   The Arduino sends the move data via serial or other communication channel to our Node.js-based server.

3. **Web App & Database**  
   - Logs moves, stores games, and delivers real-time visual updates.  
   - Offers analysis features, user accounts, and game history.

4. **Feedback to the Board**  
   - LED lights or audio prompts may be triggered based on the game state or training mode settings.
